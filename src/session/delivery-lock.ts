/**
 * Per-session serialization of the delivery transaction.
 *
 * Delivery is not a single write. It is nudge -> payload -> settle -> submit,
 * and any interleaving of two of those corrupts both messages. Moving delivery
 * into the main process gave one writer *location*; it did not give one
 * serialized *operation*. Two concurrent senders — Telegram and inter-session,
 * or a send and a recovery resend — could each nudge and then write.
 *
 * The gate is per session: delivering to one session must never hold up
 * delivery to another. It is also deliberately narrow. Two things stay outside
 * it, and both are load-bearing:
 *
 * - `PtyManager.write`, so the user's own keystrokes never queue behind a bulk
 *   delivery.
 * - The delivery-verification polling window, which can run for seconds. See
 *   `deliverPromptSequenceToSession` for why holding it there would deadlock
 *   recovery outright.
