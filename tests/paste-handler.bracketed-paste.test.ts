/**
 * Unit tests for the bracketed-paste decision helpers.
 *
 * These are pure — they take the facts the caller already has (does the view
 * report the mode, is it on, is the text multiline) and return a decision, so
 * they need no terminal, no session state, and no mocks. The imperative
 * delivery path in paste-handler.ts consumes them.
 *
 * Regression origin: background delivery (inter-session MCP + Telegram) was
 * excluded from bracketed paste unconditionally, so a multi-line envelope went
 * in as raw PTY input. A TUI line editor reads each embedded newline as Enter,
 * submits line-by-line, and the recipient only ever sees the final fragment —
 * the "head of the message is lost, the tail arrives" bug.
