/**
 * Delivery is a serialized per-session transaction.
 *
 * The transaction is nudge -> payload -> settle -> submit. Two concurrent
 * senders — Telegram and inter-session, or a send and a recovery resend — used
 * to each nudge and then write independently, interleaving one message's resize
 * and payload with the other's. A lock inside the write alone would not fix it:
 * both callers can nudge before either writes.
 *
 * These tests drive two genuinely overlapping deliveries against a real
 * PtyManager and a fake PTY that records resizes and writes in one ordered
 * stream, so an unserialized implementation shows up as interleaved bytes
 * rather than as a missing mutex. Every test here was run red against the
 * unlocked code before the lock existed.
