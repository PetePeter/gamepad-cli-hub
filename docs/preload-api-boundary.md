# Preload API Boundary

The renderer still reaches Electron through `contextBridge`. The migration target is not to bypass the window boundary, but to replace the broad `window.gamepadCli` facade with owned domain clients under `window.helm.<domain>`.

`src/electron/preload-api-contract.ts` is the checked-in inventory for the current legacy surface. `tests/preload-api-contract.test.ts` parses `src/electron/preload.ts` directly and fails when a legacy method is added without a domain assignment.

## Compatibility Policy

- Keep `contextBridge` as the only Electron exposure boundary.
- Keep `window.gamepadCli` as a compatibility facade until external/test callers migrate.
- Additions to the legacy facade must be assigned to exactly one target domain.
- New renderer code must use `renderer/ipc/clients.ts` instead of `window.gamepadCli`.

## Legacy Allowlist

Direct `window.gamepadCli` references are allowed only in:

- `renderer/ipc/clients.ts`, the compatibility fallback adapter.
- `src/electron/main.ts`, the startup preload smoke check.
- `src/electron/preload-api-contract.ts`, the policy text tested by the contract suite.

`tests/preload-api-contract.test.ts` enforces this list across `renderer` and `src/electron`.

| `window.helm.tools` | configured CLI tools and their ordering |
| `window.helm.profiles` | profile list, active profile, switching, creation, and deletion |
| `window.helm.projects` | project list, CRUD, and directory membership |

| `window.helm.keyboard` | key tap, combo send/down/up, and typed string |
| `window.helm.dialog` | folder/file dialogs, external editor, and temporary content files |

| `window.helm.events` | renderer subscriptions for PTY, delivery, notifications, sessions, plan, incoming, pattern, and scheduler events |

## Current Legacy Inventory

The exhaustive current-method list lives in `PRELOAD_API_DOMAINS`. That source is intentionally code, not prose, so review and CI catch drift whenever the preload facade changes.
